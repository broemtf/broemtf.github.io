<h1>Basic Introduction</h1>
<body>
<p>I lived the first seven years of my life in <i>Lusaka, Zambia</I>. I attended a school called the American International School of Lusaka (AISL)<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_International_School_of_Lusaka">Wikipedia Article on AISL</a>. In 2008 my family and I moved to Baltimore Maryland where we continued to live for the rest of my childhood.

<h2>Continued Introduction</h2>

<p>For both middle school and high school I chose to attend what are called <b>magnet schools</b> <a href="https://dci.bcps.org/department/educational_options/educational_opportunities/magnet_programs/magnet_programs_descriptions">Description of Magnet Schools</a>. I chose to focus on visual arts at these magnet schools and received an intensive education in both classical figure painting and sculpture. However, when it came time to decide what to study in college I chose <u>Biochemistry</u> because despite my interest in fine arts it would be unsustainable for me as a career choice because I love learning and collaborating with others in a way that is not possible in the fine arts.
